          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subject I learned
          were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I 
          honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

          the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.

          personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."

        Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

        Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.
        I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn 
        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the 
        program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
        They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
        The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
        learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
        In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
        development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack 
        developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!
