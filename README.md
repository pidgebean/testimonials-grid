### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project was pretty simple - it was just a way to practice interesting website layouts. The only thing I struggled with was centering the content on different sized screens.

### Continued development

It doesn't quite look right on the ipad screen - the content is right on the border of the screen. In the future, I plan to adjudt a few values to fix that.
